- `GreenIndustries.xlsx`: allocation of SIC in Green industries based on ONS. Columns A-C have been adopted from [UK environmental goods and services sector (EGSS) methodology annex](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/datasets/ukenvironmentalgoodsandservicessectoregssmethodologyannex). Columns D-E are assigned based on the metadata of the same document.

-- If columns D and E are listed as "NA", matching to SIC was not successful. An alternative to match Activities, would be to use the [Low Carbon and Renewable
Energy Economy (LCREE) Survey data](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=8206). LCREE survey allows the allocation of LCREE sectors to SIC Sections.
